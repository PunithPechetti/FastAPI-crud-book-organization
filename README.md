I have built a simple book organisation Fastapi CRUD application using MangoDB for database related queries and operations, 
The database has two collections called books and users and I have added the following operations in the application:
For users
1.Create a new user
2.Get all users
3.Delete a user
For Books
1.Add a book to the db
2.Get all books
3.Get a book by id
4.Delete a book
The app also has
1.Add a book to a user's list
2.Update user's list
3.Get all books in a specific user's list
